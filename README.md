# The GitOps Icon

## Repository content

The [derived](https://github.com/giantswarm/gitops-icon/tree/main/derived) folder provides the files you might be interested in when using the icon.

The folder [original](https://github.com/giantswarm/gitops-icon/tree/main/original) contains the Adobe Illustrator file used to create the derivatives.

## Why

For our own [web user interface](https://github.com/giantswarm/happa), we needed an icon to indicate the fact that a resource is managed in a GitOps way. Since there was no icon out there at that point, we created one.

The icon is likely to work better for users the more often they see and recognize it. So our users would benefit from it becoming common sense. And you might have a similar need in your application. So why should you solve the same problem in a different way if you can re-use our solution? It's about synergies.
